-- =====================================================================
-- Module 8d: deleting an account also closes the person's open listings.
--
-- Listings stay visible (like posts and comments) but a Sell listing
-- from a deleted seller would stay "for sale" with nobody to answer, so
-- their open listings are marked closed (Sold / Returned). Everything
-- else in delete_my_account is unchanged from 20261026100000.
